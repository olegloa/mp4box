It is written in (almost 100% ANSI) C for portability reasons           (embedded platforms and DSPs), attempting to keep the memory footprint as low as possible.           It is currently running under Windows, Linux, WindowsCE (SmartPhone, PocketPC 2002/2003) (3D rendering through OpenGL-ES),           Embedded Linux (familiar 8, GPE) and SymbianOS.</p>				        <p>          The project is intended to a wide audience ranging from end-users or           content creators with development skills who want to experiment the new           standards for interactive technologies or want to convert files for           mobile devices, to developers who need players and/or server for multimedia           streaming applications.            </p>        <p>          The GPAC framework is being developed at           <a href="http://www.enst.fr">ENST (Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications)</a>           as part of research work on digital media.        </p>                      <h2>Supported Tools</h2>				<p>GPAC can probably be seen as the most advanced and robust 2D MPEG-4 Player publicly available worldwide, as well as a decent 3D player. It also has some good support for X3D, W3C SVG Tiny 1.2, and 3GPP features.</p>				<p>GPAC also features MPEG-4 Systems encoders and multiplexers, publishing and content distribution tools for MP4 and 3GPP(2) files and many tools for scene descriptions (MPEG4/VRML/X3D converters, SWF/MPEG-4, etc...) For more information on supported tools, check out the <a href="feat.php">features</a> page.</p>        <p>          The project started in 2003 with the initial goal to develop from scratch,           in ANSI C, clean software compliant to the MPEG-4 Systems standard,           a small and flexible alternative to the MPEG-4 reference software.           Since then, the project has evolved and features now three sets of tools:           <ul>            <li>A multimedia player, called <a href="player.php">Osmo4</a>,</li>             <li>A multimedia packager, called <a href="packager.php">MP4Box</a>,</li>             <li>And some server tools.</li>           </ul>        </p>				<h2>Licencing</h2>				<p>As of version 0.4.0 GPAC is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
