We will therefore not let you wander through the obscur countries of MPEG-4 without a safe place to rest, gather your ideas and meet other pioneers. When tutorials, demo content and all possible tips are not enough, there is still hope in the MPEG-4 Authoring Forum.</p><p>Also remember to carefully look at the supported features page to be sure you're not using unsupported features.</p><h1>Available Tools</h1><p>There are several tools available for MPEG-4 content creation, but only MP4Box handles the BT format used in the regression tests and the tutorial samples.</p><p>You may try some other tools (from IM1 ref soft, IBM's or ENVIVIO's tools), but you will be alone there...</p><p>This section is under permanant construction, so do not hesitate to request sections on specific parts of the MPEG-4 Systems standard or GPAC tools.</p><h1>Tutorials</h1><p>There are very few tutorials on XMT-A and MPEG-4 authoring available on the internet, and we are therefore very pleased to give you a step-by-step introduction to MPEG-4.The following tutorial has been written for ENST's student in 2002, and has slowly been updated to the current stage. </p><p>This tutorial will be rewritten in the near future, so do not hesitate to send back comments, feedback, requests on this topic. </p><p><a href="auth_tutorial_eng.php">BIFS Tutorial in English</a></p><p><a href="auth_tutorial_fr.php">BIFS Tutorial in French</a></p>	</div><?php include_once("bas.php"); ?><!-- =================== FIN CADRE DE LA PAGE =========================================  --></div></body></html>
